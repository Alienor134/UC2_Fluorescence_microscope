# Purpose

Microscopy is a critical experimental tool in life sciences. However, when attempting to reproduce or scale-up a published method, researchers often meet difficulties in implementing specific protocols, often because they do not have full control over the hardware and software. 

To address these challenges, we present a modular open-source hardware and software pipeline that integrates automation and database management. 

We provide comprehensive guidance on building and calibrating the microscope hardware, implementing automation, and data analysis and storage methods. The highly modular Python software we introduce facilitate customization and reusability beyond microscopy, empowering researchers and engineers to adapt components for other scientific applications.

The microscope presented here is a simplified and open-source version of the microscope used in [this publication](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.23.633867). The 3D structure was derived from the [Open-UC2](https://openuc2.com/) library.



In this repository we provide: 
- A [bill of materials](bill_of_materials.md) to reproduce the microscope 
- [Build instructions](build)
- Python packages to use the library: they each have their specific documentation
- [Usage example](automate.md) with support codes
